**Changes and Removals in the Code:**

**Vulnerability Test Functions:**
- **test_sql_injection:** Updated the code for SQL Injection tests and added more detailed vulnerability information.
- **test_xss:** Added XSS tests and updated the code.
- **test_csrf:** Added CSRF tests.
- **test_command_injection:** Added Command Injection tests.
- **test_file_upload_vulnerability:** Added a template for file upload vulnerability tests, but it has been implemented and might not work properly.
- **deep_vulnerability_scanning:** Added a template for deep vulnerability scanning, but it has been implemented and might not work properly.
- **test_rfi:** Added Remote File Inclusion (RFI) tests.
- **test_lfi:** Added Local File Inclusion (LFI) tests.
- **test_open_redirect:** Added Open Redirect tests.
- **test_security_headers:** Added security headers check.
- **test_time_based_blind_sqli:** Added Time-Based Blind SQL Injection tests.

**Newly Added Functions:**
- **combine_vulnerabilities:** Function to combine vulnerabilities and create chained attack scenarios.
- **execute_attack_chain:** Function to execute chained attack scenarios.

**Removed Sections:**
- **test_sqli:** Removed independently as SQL Injection tests are comprehensively covered within other functions.
- **test_open_redirect** and **test_security_headers:** These were not present in previous versions but have been added in the updated version.

With these updates, chained attack scenarios have been added, and functions displaying detailed results have been updated. Further changes or additions can be made as needed.
